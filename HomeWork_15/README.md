# 🚗 Task 1: IVehicle Interface Implementation

This project demonstrates how to implement an `IVehicle` interface in C# with two methods: `Drive` and `Refuel`. A `Car` class is created to implement this interface.

## 🧩 Features
- Interface with `Drive()` and `Refuel(decimal amount)` methods
- `Car` class implements the interface
- User input for refueling
- Displays message if the car can drive

## 🛠 How It Works
- If fuel is greater than 0, `Drive()` prints "Driving"
- `Refuel()` increases gasoline and returns `true`

# 🐶 Task 2: Abstract Animal Class

This C# project implements an abstract class `Animal` with a `Dog` class inheriting from it. The project demonstrates the concept of abstract methods.

## 🧩 Features
- Abstract class with `Name` property and abstract `Eat()` method
- Dog class overrides `Eat()`
- Set and get dog name
- Outputs dog’s name and that it is eating

# 📚 Task 3: Library Management System

This project simulates a simple library system with a `Book` class that implements `Readable` and `Borrowable` interfaces.

## 🧩 Features
- Abstract class `AbstractBook` with title and author
- Interface `Readable` with `Read()` method
- Interface `Borrowable` with `Borrow()` and `ReturnBook()` methods
- Concrete `Book` class implements all
